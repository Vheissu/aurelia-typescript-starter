# Aurelia TypeScript Starter
This is a start for those wanting a clean slate with some added goodies like Sass, Autoprefixer and the junk example code you get in the Skeleton. This is the best possible way to start a TypeScript application in Aurelia (until something better comes along). Electron support has also been removed as this is a web focused starter, not for applications.

## Dependencies
Open up a Terminal/Command Prompt or PowerShell window and run these commands in the application directory.

1. npm install gulp jspm typings typescript -g
2. npm install
3. jspm install -y
4. gulp build
